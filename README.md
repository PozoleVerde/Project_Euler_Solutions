# Project_Euler_Solutions

These are my attempts at solving project Euler problems.

To run the programs on ubuntu 17.10:

<code>gcc -o executibleName problem1.c </code>

While there are many languages I could have chosen to solve these problems, I decided to use C.
This is not because of efficiency or preference. This is because I am currently a student and am learning the language.
While my code may look primitive and unstructured it is my best attempt with the current knowledge and research of libraries i have.

Feel free to improve effiency as you please.
