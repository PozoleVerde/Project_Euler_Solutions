# Project_Euler_Solutions
DESCRIPTION:
  These are my attempts at solving project Euler problems.

RUNNING IT:
  Ubuntu 17.10:

    gcc -o executibleName problemx.c
    ./executibleName

  Windows:
  
    gcc <filename>.c
    filename.exe

  IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS:
    Ensure that you have GCC installed. To download GCC go to www.mingw.org
  
DISCLAIMER:

  While there are many languages I could have chosen to solve these problems, I decided to use C.
  This is not because of efficiency or preference. This is because I am currently a student and am learning the language.
  While my code may look primitive and unstructured it is my best attempt with the current knowledge and research of libraries   i have.

Feel free to improve effiency as you please.
